## Configuration

### Environment Variables
The application uses in-memory storage by default. For production deployment with PostgreSQL:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/hercules
```

### Customization
- **Styling**: Modify `client/src/index.css` for theme customization
- **Data Sources**: Update `server/storage.ts` for real data integration
- **Facility Configuration**: Edit `shared/schema.ts` for facility definitions

## Development

### Adding New Features
1. Define data types in `shared/schema.ts`
2. Update storage interface in `server/storage.ts`
3. Add API routes in `server/routes.ts`
4. Create frontend components in `client/src/components/`
5. Add pages in `client/src/pages/` and register in `client/src/App.tsx`

### Database Integration
The project is configured for PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM. To enable database storage:
1. Set `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
2. Run `npm run db:generate` to create migrations
3. Run `npm run db:migrate` to apply schema changes

## Production Deployment

### Building for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

### Deployment Options
